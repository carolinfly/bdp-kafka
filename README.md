## Kafka Introduction and Stories
Apache Kafka is a distributed open-source streaming platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. 

Apache Kafka was originally developed by LinkedIn, and was subsequently open sourced in early 2011. In November 2014, several engineers who worked on Kafka at LinkedIn created a new company named Confluent with a focus on Kafka. According to a Quora post from 2014, Jay Kreps seems to have named it after the author Franz Kafka. Kreps chose to name the system after an author because it is "a system optimized for writing", and he liked Kafka's work. 

Kafka aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka could also connect to external systems for data import or export via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams.
