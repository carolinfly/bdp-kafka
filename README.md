## Dataset
 * [Credit card fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud) 

## Instructions

 * Install git or the github desktop client
 * Install docker with docker-compose
 * If you need to install python 3, you can use Miniconda above
 * Clone this repository
 * Download the dataset and unzip it
 * Start the docker containers
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
   ```
 * Verify that the containers are up. Neither container should say `Exited`
 ```bash
  docker ps -a
 ```
 * To view that the topics were created successfully, we need to use the Kafka container to run the kafka scripts.
 ```bash
  docker exec bdpkafka_kafka_1 bash -c 'kafka-topics.sh  --list --zookeeper $KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT'
 ```
 * You should see 3 topics listed: `raw`, `preprocessed`, `decision`
 * Copy the dataset we're using to seed Kafka to the python container
 ```bash
 docker cp <path_to_downloaded_and_unzipped_dataset> bdpkafka_python_1:/tmp/creditcard.csv
 ```
 * Run the script to push data to the Kafka brokers
 ```bash
 docker exec bdpkafka_python_1 python /bdp/activity_producer.py /tmp/creditcard.csv
 ```
 * Lets verify the messages are there. This involves once again running a command with the kafka  docker container.
 ```bash
 docker exec bdpkafka_kafka_1 bash -c 'kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell --broker-list kafka:9092 --topic raw'
 ```
 * You should see the number of messages in the topic, which should be one less than the number of lines in your csv file(i.e. minus the header)
 * To stop the docker containers:
 ```bash
 docker-compose down
 ```
